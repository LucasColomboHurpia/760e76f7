My aplication for the Front End Development test for Speer Technologies.

Features
Activity Feed: The Activity Feed shows a simple list of recent calls that are not archived. Calls are grouped by date for easy viewing.

Activity Detail: Users can click on a call to see detailed information such as the caller’s number, callee’s number, call duration, and time of call.

Archive/Unarchive Calls: Users can archive or unarchive individual calls. Archived calls are removed from the Activity Feed and shown in a separate Archived Calls tab.

Archive All Calls Button: In the Activity Feed, a button allows users to archive all displayed calls with one click.

Unarchive All Calls Button: In the Archived Calls tab, a button lets users unarchive all calls at once.

Dark Mode Toggle: A toggle button enables users to switch between light and dark modes. The app saves this preference and applies appropriate styles.
